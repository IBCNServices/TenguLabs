# Tengu Labs

The IDLab Tengu platform (Ghent University â€“ imec) is a platform for experimentation with complex technologies. While its initial focus was mainly on big data experimentation, it now supports a wide variety of frameworks, backed by a fully managed Kubernetes cluster. With Tengu, it is a breeze to start experimenting and to take your first steps into this new world. The library of managed components is continuously expanded.
